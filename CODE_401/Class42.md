><li> How are the ads shown in your application determined when using Google AdMob?

Ads shown in your application when using Google AdMob are determined through a process that involves various factors and algorithms designed to maximize revenue while providing relevant and engaging ads to your users. Here's how the ads are determined:

1. **Ad Unit Configuration:** You, as the app developer, create ad space in your app by defining ad units within AdMob. These ad units specify where and how ads will appear in your app, such as banner ads, interstitial ads, rewarded ads, etc.

2. **Ad Request:** When a user interacts with your app, such as opening it or navigating to a specific section, your app code sends ad requests to AdMob, indicating the ad units that are available for display.

3. **Auction Process:** AdMob conducts an auction process to determine which ad should be displayed. During this process, AdMob considers several factors, including:

   - **Advertiser Bids:** Advertisers bid different amounts of money to display their ads to users. These bids may vary based on factors like the ad's format, targeting options, and competition from other advertisers.

   - **User Profile:** AdMob may consider user data (while respecting privacy regulations) to select ads that are more likely to be relevant and engaging to the user based on their demographics, interests, and past behavior.

   - **Historical Performance:** AdMob analyzes the historical performance of ads, including click-through rates (CTR) and user engagement, to identify ads that are likely to perform well in your app.

4. **Ad Display:** AdMob's algorithms determine the best-performing ad(s) based on the auction results and user profile data. The selected ad is then displayed to the user in your app's ad space.

5. **Optimization:** AdMob continually optimizes ad selection to ensure that the highest-performing ads are displayed to maximize revenue for you as the app developer.

6. **Payment:** AdMob handles billing and payment processes with advertisers and ad networks. You receive a share of the revenue generated from the ads displayed in your app, typically based on a revenue-sharing model.

It's important to note that AdMob aims to strike a balance between maximizing revenue for app developers and providing a positive user experience. AdMob's algorithms aim to show relevant and engaging ads to users while respecting user privacy and adhering to industry standards and regulations.

><li> What are the platforms which support Google AdMob?

Google AdMob is a mobile advertising platform that can be integrated into various mobile app platforms and operating systems. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, Google AdMob supports the following major mobile platforms:

1. **Android:** AdMob offers robust support for Android apps, allowing developers to monetize their Android applications by displaying ads. This includes both smartphones and tablets running the Android operating system.

2. **iOS (Apple):** AdMob also provides comprehensive support for iOS apps, enabling developers to monetize their iPhone and iPad applications through the integration of AdMob's ad units.

3. **Unity:** AdMob has developed a plugin for the Unity game development engine. This allows game developers to easily incorporate AdMob ads into their Unity-based games, making it a popular choice for mobile game monetization.

4. **Cocos2d-x:** Cocos2d-x is an open-source game development framework, and AdMob has support for integrating ads into apps and games developed using this framework.

5. **Adobe AIR:** Adobe AIR is a platform for building mobile apps using web technologies, and AdMob can be integrated into apps created with Adobe AIR.

6. **Xamarin:** Developers using Xamarin, a cross-platform app development framework, can also integrate AdMob ads into their Android and iOS apps.

Please note that the availability and support for specific platforms and frameworks may evolve over time, so it's essential to check the official Google AdMob documentation and resources for the most up-to-date information on platform compatibility and integration guides. Additionally, new platforms may have been added since my last update in September 2021.

><li> What are some of the ways you can make money in your app by monetizing with Google?

Monetizing your mobile app using Google AdMob offers various ways to generate revenue. Here are some of the primary methods:

1. **In-App Banner Ads:** You can integrate banner ads into your app's user interface. Banner ads are typically displayed at the top or bottom of the screen and are relatively unobtrusive. When users interact with these ads (e.g., by clicking on them), you earn revenue.

2. **Interstitial Ads:** Interstitial ads are full-screen ads that appear at natural transition points in your app, such as between levels in a game or after the user has completed a specific action. They offer higher engagement and often generate more revenue than banner ads.

3. **Rewarded Video Ads:** Rewarded video ads are optional video advertisements that users can choose to watch in exchange for in-app rewards, such as virtual currency, power-ups, or access to premium content. Users opt-in to view these ads, making them highly engaging.

4. **Native Ads:** Native ads blend seamlessly with your app's content and design, providing a non-disruptive advertising experience. They can be customized to match your app's look and feel while still generating revenue.

5. **App Open Ads:** These ads appear when users launch your app, creating a splash screen or full-screen ad experience upon app startup. They are typically shown in a non-intrusive manner and can help boost revenue.

6. **Smart Segmentation:** AdMob uses machine learning to segment your users and display ads that are most relevant to them. This can increase user engagement with ads, resulting in higher earnings.

7. **Mediation:** AdMob offers mediation, allowing you to integrate multiple ad networks into your app. This can help maximize your revenue by displaying ads from various sources and optimizing their performance.

8. **AdMob Network:** AdMob has its ad network, which can provide a consistent source of ads for your app. It includes both text and image ads, giving you flexibility in ad formats.

9. **Ad Targeting:** AdMob provides advanced targeting options, allowing you to display ads to users based on factors such as demographics, location, user behavior, and more. Targeted ads can be more effective and yield higher revenue.

10. **AdMob Rewarded Interstitials:** These are a combination of interstitial and rewarded video ads. Users are shown a full-screen ad, and upon completion, they receive a reward, making it a compelling option for game developers.

11. **AdMob for Games:** AdMob offers special features for game developers, including playable ads that let users try out a game before downloading it.

12. **AdMob for Kids Apps:** AdMob has specific guidelines and ad formats designed for apps directed at children, ensuring compliance with regulations and offering age-appropriate content.

It's important to strike a balance between monetization and user experience. Excessive or intrusive ads can discourage users and lead to app abandonment. Therefore, consider user preferences and feedback when implementing ads in your app to create a positive and profitable experience.
