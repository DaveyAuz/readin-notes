><li> Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence?

The article primarily focuses on the ethical dimensions of cybernetics and its contemporary counterpart, digitization. It opens with a fundamental premise that cybernetics is the science of information and control, irrespective of whether the target is a machine or a living organism. This definition sets the stage for discussing how the control aspect of cybernetics has evolved and expanded in the digital age.

One of the central concerns raised in the article is the pervasive use of control strategies in modern society. The authors argue that everything can now be controlled, thanks to the extensive collection of data facilitated by digitization and the power of artificial intelligence. This assertion underscores the ethical dilemmas arising from the ever-increasing control over individuals and societal systems.

Historical examples are provided to illustrate the real-world implications of cybernetics. The article highlights how both the US armed forces and the Soviet Union applied cybernetics during the 20th century to control the arms race. This historical context serves as a backdrop for understanding the roots of modern control strategies.

The article draws parallels between cybernetics and digitization, emphasizing that the latter can be seen as the most perfect implementation of the former. With the widespread use of smart devices, individuals generate an unending data stream that discloses their intentions, location, and social environment. This wealth of data becomes the input for control strategies, which increasingly govern our daily lives. Digital assistants, learning machines, and even search engines like Google are cited as examples of how control strategies operate.

An essential point made in the article is the concept of the closed-loop feedback, a fundamental idea in cybernetics. Feedback, which includes actions like giving likes and making online comments, is closely tied to the digitization era. It is noted that digitization has amplified the feedback loop, enabling technology to profile individuals and make predictions about their future behavior. This, in turn, fuels automated control strategies aimed at influencing individuals towards more "desirable" states.

The article highlights the ethical dilemma posed by the monetization of data and the control of information by tech giants like Google. By prioritizing corporate interests over user needs, these companies have been accused of misuse and, in some cases, of monopolistic practices. The European Union's concerns in this regard are mentioned as an example of the pushback against such misuse.

Ultimately, the article suggests that individuals have a role to play in safeguarding their digital rights and privacy. It proposes the idea of disconnecting from the cybernetic loop as a way to counter excessive control. However, it acknowledges that this may become increasingly challenging as digitization continues to advance.

In conclusion, this article provides a comprehensive exploration of the ethical complexities surrounding cybernetics and digitization. It underscores the need for society to grapple with these issues, advocate for digital freedom, and establish safeguards against the misuse of technology. The comparison between cybernetics and digitization highlights the evolution of control strategies and emphasizes the ethical considerations that must accompany technological progress.
