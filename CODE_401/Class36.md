><li> Where in your application should you check the current auth session?

You should check the current auth session in your application where it makes the most sense in terms of user experience and functionality. Typically, you would want to check the current auth session in places where you need to determine if a user is authenticated or not. This helps in controlling the access to certain features, screens, or functionalities based on the user's authentication status.

Here are a few common scenarios where you might want to check the current auth session:

1. **App Launch (OnStartup):** It's common to check the auth session when your app starts up. This way, you can determine whether the user is already signed in or not, and you can navigate them to the appropriate screen. For instance, if the user is already signed in, you might directly take them to the home screen; otherwise, you might show them the sign-in or sign-up screen.

2. **Access to Protected Content:** If your app has content or features that should only be accessible to authenticated users, you should check the auth session before allowing access. For example, if you have a profile screen or a dashboard that requires authentication, you can check the auth session before allowing the user to access that screen.

3. **Performing Actions:** Certain actions within your app might require authentication, such as submitting a post, making a purchase, or accessing personal data. You should check the auth session before allowing the user to perform such actions.

4. **API Requests:** If your app interacts with a backend server or APIs, you might want to check the auth session before making authenticated requests. This ensures that the user is signed in before making requests that require authentication.

5. **Settings and Account Management:** If your app has settings or account management screens, you might want to display different options based on whether the user is authenticated or not. Checking the auth session helps tailor the user experience accordingly.

Remember that the goal is to provide a seamless and secure user experience. By checking the auth session at the appropriate places, you can ensure that users are guided to the right screens and features based on their authentication status.

In the provided example code, the `Amplify.Auth.fetchAuthSession` method is used to check the current auth session. You can place this code in the `onCreate` method of your MainActivity or any other relevant location based on your app's structure and requirements.

><li> what is the command that is used to push your changes to the cloud?

To push your changes, including backend configuration changes, to the cloud using the Amplify CLI, you use the following command:

```
amplify push
```

This command deploys the changes you've made to your local backend environment (such as adding or updating categories like authentication, storage, APIs, etc.) to the corresponding cloud environment (like AWS services). It ensures that the cloud resources are provisioned and configured according to your defined settings and configurations in your local project.

Before using the `amplify push` command, make sure you're in your project directory and have already added and configured the necessary resources using the Amplify CLI. This command will prompt you to review the changes that will be applied to the cloud resources and confirm before actually pushing the changes.

Keep in mind that this command can potentially modify cloud resources, so it's important to review the changes carefully before confirming.

><li> What does Amplify Auth do for your application?

Amplify Auth is a category within the AWS Amplify framework that provides authentication and authorization capabilities for your application. It simplifies the process of adding user authentication and access control to your app by abstracting the underlying complexities of authentication services and providing a consistent API for different authentication providers.

Here's what Amplify Auth does for your application:

1. **User Authentication:** Amplify Auth enables you to implement user authentication mechanisms easily. It supports various authentication methods like username and password, social identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook), and more. This means you can allow users to sign up, sign in, and sign out using different authentication methods without needing to handle the intricacies of each provider's authentication process directly.

2. **Session Management:** Amplify Auth manages user sessions, keeping track of whether a user is currently signed in or not. This is crucial for controlling access to different parts of your app based on the user's authentication status. You can use this information to determine if a user is authorized to access specific features or content.

3. **Security:** Amplify Auth ensures that user authentication is carried out securely. It handles the storage and encryption of sensitive user data, such as passwords and tokens, using industry-standard security practices.

4. **Integration with Other Amplify Categories:** Amplify Auth integrates seamlessly with other categories within the Amplify framework. For example, if your app requires API access, Amplify Auth provides the necessary authentication tokens for secure communication with backend APIs.

5. **UI Components (Authenticator UI):** Amplify Auth offers UI components that you can integrate into your app's interface to provide a ready-to-use authentication flow. This includes screens for sign-in, sign-up, password recovery, and more. The Authenticator UI component streamlines the process of integrating authentication flows into your app's user interface.

6. **Customization:** While Amplify Auth provides default authentication behaviors, it also allows for customization. You can configure various settings, such as password policies, user attributes, and more, to tailor the authentication process to your app's needs.

7. **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Amplify Auth supports single sign-on, allowing users to use the same set of credentials to access multiple services or applications within your ecosystem.

8. **User Management:** You can manage user accounts, profiles, and attributes through Amplify Auth. This includes features like updating user information, resetting passwords, and handling account recovery.

In summary, Amplify Auth abstracts the complexities of implementing user authentication and provides a unified interface to manage authentication and access control in your application. It simplifies the process of integrating various authentication providers while maintaining a secure and user-friendly authentication experience.
