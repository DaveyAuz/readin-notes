><li> What is node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine that is used in Google Chrome, and it enables server-side execution of JavaScript code, making it a popular choice for building scalable network applications.

With Node.js, developers can use JavaScript to build server-side applications, command-line tools, and other types of software that run on a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Node.js provides a range of built-in modules and APIs for handling various tasks, such as networking, file system operations, and HTTP/HTTPS server and client functionality.

One of the key features of Node.js is its non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle a large number of concurrent connections and requests without blocking the event loop. This makes it highly scalable and efficient for building high-performance applications.

Node.js has a large and active community of developers and contributors, and it has become a popular choice for building web servers, microservices, and other types of network applications. It is used by companies such as Netflix, Uber, LinkedIn, and PayPal, among others.

><li> In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine is a high-performance, open-source JavaScript engine that is used in the Google Chrome web browser and in other applications such as Node.js. It is designed to execute JavaScript code quickly and efficiently by compiling JavaScript code into machine code before executing it.

The V8 engine uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to optimize the execution of JavaScript code. When a web page is loaded, V8 compiles the JavaScript code in the page into machine code, which is executed directly by the processor. This can result in significant performance improvements over traditional interpreted JavaScript engines, which execute JavaScript code line-by-line as it is encountered.

The V8 engine is written in C++ and includes a range of optimization techniques, such as inline caching, hidden classes, and adaptive compilation, to further improve performance. It also includes a range of built-in features and APIs for handling various tasks, such as garbage collection, threading, and debugging.

Overall, the V8 engine is an important component of the modern web platform, enabling the creation of highly interactive and performant web applications.

><li> What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
When we say that Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, it means that it provides an environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js includes a JavaScript engine, similar to the one used in web browsers, which allows it to interpret and execute JavaScript code.

As a JavaScript runtime, Node.js provides access to a range of built-in modules and APIs that can be used to perform various tasks, such as reading and writing files, creating network connections, and handling HTTP requests and responses. These modules and APIs are available through the Node.js runtime environment and can be used directly from JavaScript code.

Node.js also provides a range of tools and features that make it easier to develop and debug JavaScript code for server-side applications, including a command-line interface, a package manager (npm), and a built-in debugger.

Overall, by providing a JavaScript runtime outside of the browser, Node.js allows developers to use the same language and skills for both client-side and server-side development, making it easier to build full-stack web applications.

</li>

><li> What is npm?
npm (short for Node Package Manager) is a package manager for the Node.js runtime environment. It is used to install, manage, and share packages (libraries and modules) written in JavaScript that can be used in Node.js applications.

With npm, developers can easily add third-party packages to their projects, and manage the dependencies between different packages. npm maintains a registry of packages that developers can browse and search to find the packages they need.

npm also provides a command-line interface (CLI) for managing packages, which allows developers to install, update, and remove packages from their projects with a simple command. npm also provides a range of tools for managing package versions, publishing packages, and managing user accounts.

Overall, npm is a key tool for the Node.js ecosystem, enabling developers to easily share and reuse code, and to build complex applications more efficiently. It is widely used by developers and companies around the world, and is an essential component of many modern web applications.

><li> What version of node are you running on your machine?
I am currently running version 9.5.1 of node.js

</li>


><li> What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
To install the "jshint" package using npm, you can open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:npm install jshint
This will download the "jshint" package from the npm registry and install it in your project's "node_modules" folder. You can then use the package in your Node.js application by importing it into your code using the require() function.

><li> What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together on a single computer to complete a task. There are many reasons why pair programming can be beneficial for developers and organizations, but here are six key reasons:

>1. Greater efficiency
>2. Engaged collaboration
>3. Learning from fellow students
>4. Social skills
>5. Job interview readiness
>6. Work environment readiness

Here are 6 additional reason I come up with for paired programming:

*   Improved code quality: Pair programming can lead to higher code quality, as two developers working together can catch errors and bugs more easily, and can provide constructive feedback on each other's code.

*   Faster problem-solving: Two heads are often better than one when it comes to problem-solving. Pair programming can lead to faster problem-solving as developers can work together to identify and fix issues more efficiently.

*   Knowledge sharing: Pair programming can be an effective way for developers to share knowledge and learn from each other. This can lead to a more collaborative and inclusive work environment.

*   Reduced knowledge silos: Pair programming can help to reduce knowledge silos by ensuring that multiple developers have a good understanding of the codebase. This can reduce the risk of a single developer becoming a bottleneck in the development process.

*   Improved communication skills: Pair programming can help to improve communication skills as developers must communicate and collaborate effectively to work together successfully.

*   Increased team morale: Pair programming can be a fun and engaging way for developers to work together, which can lead to increased team morale and job satisfaction.

</li>

><li> In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
Knowledge sharing, AKA Engaged collaboration, Learning from fellow students: Pair programming can be an effective way for developers to share knowledge and learn from each other. This can lead to a more collaborative and inclusive work environment.

><li>How does pair programming work?
Pair programming is a software development technique where two programmers work together on one computer to develop code. Typically, one programmer is the driver who writes the code, while the other programmer is the navigator who reviews each line of code as it is written.

Here are the basic steps for pair programming:

*   Choose a task to work on: The pair should decide on a task to work on together. This could be fixing a bug, implementing a new feature, or improving an existing one.

*   Choose roles: One person will be the driver who writes the code, and the other person will be the navigator who reviews the code as it is written.

*   Start coding: The driver begins coding while the navigator reviews each line of code as it is written. The navigator provides feedback and suggests improvements.

*   Switch roles: After a certain amount of time, the two programmers should switch roles. This allows each person to experience both roles and gain different perspectives on the code.

*   Communicate: Effective communication is key to successful pair programming. The pair should communicate frequently, asking questions and explaining their thought processes.

*   Take breaks: Pair programming can be intense, so it's important to take breaks and recharge as needed.

Benefits of pair programming include increased code quality, improved collaboration and communication skills, faster problem-solving, and knowledge sharing between team members.
