>1) What does .map() return?
   
 In programming, the .map() method is often used with arrays in JavaScript and other languages. It applies a function to each element of the array and returns a new array with the results. The return value of .map() is a new array containing the values returned by the function for each element in the original array. In summary, the .map() method returns a new array that contains the results of applying a function to each element of an original array.

> 2) If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React? 

In React, you can loop through an array and display each value in JSX using the .map() method.

> 3) Each list item needs a unique ____.
 Each item in a list or an array needs a unique key. In programming, a key is a unique identifier that is assigned to each element in a collection (such as a list or an array) to facilitate accessing and manipulating the elements.

For example, in JavaScript, when creating a list of elements using the map function, you need to specify a unique key attribute for each element. This key helps React to identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed, and to update the UI accordingly.

In summary, whether it is called a unique identifier, label, or key, the main idea is that each item in a list needs a way to be uniquely identified to avoid confusion and facilitate manipulation.

> 4) What is the purpose of a key?

In React, a "key" is a special attribute that helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed from a list of items rendered by a component. The purpose of using keys in React is to optimize the rendering process and improve the performance of the application.

When a component renders a list of items, React needs to be able to efficiently update the DOM to reflect any changes in the list. Without keys, React has to resort to expensive operations like removing all the old elements and rebuilding the entire list from scratch every time a change occurs. This can be slow and inefficient, especially for larger lists.

By adding a unique key attribute to each item in the list, React can quickly determine which items have changed, been added, or been removed, and update only those items that need to be updated. This makes the rendering process much faster and more efficient.

In summary, the purpose of using keys in React is to optimize the rendering process and improve the performance of the application by allowing React to efficiently update the DOM when changes occur in a list of items rendered by a component.

> 5) What is the spread operator?

The spread operator is a JavaScript feature introduced in ES6 that allows an iterable (e.g., an array or an object) to be expanded into individual elements. It is denoted by three dots "..." and can be used in a variety of ways. With arrays, the spread operator can be used to create a new array that combines the elements of two or more arrays. The spread operator is a convenient and powerful feature in JavaScript that makes it easier to work with arrays and objects.

> 6) List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

 * Merge arrays: The spread operator can be used to create a new array that combines the elements of two or more arrays.
 * Copy arrays: The spread operator can be used to create a copy of an array.
 * Merge objects: The spread operator can be used to create a new object that merges the properties of two or more objects.
 * Copy objects: The spread operator can be used to create a copy of an object.

> 7) Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

 		const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
	 	const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
	 	const combined = [...arr1, ...arr2];
 		console.log(combined); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

 > 8) Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

 		const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
 		const newItem = 4;
 		const arr2 = [...arr1, newItem];
 		console.log(arr2); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

> 9) Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

		const obj1 = {a: 1, b: 2};
		const obj2 = {c: 3, d: 4};
		const obj3 = {...obj1, ...obj2};
		console.log(obj3); // Output: {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4}
