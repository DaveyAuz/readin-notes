# Reading-Notes The Coder's Computer

This Lab & Exercise really taught me how to use markdown to create links and folders to organize a group of documents or pages which is going to be vital in future jobs to submit reports on issues, write protocols for a whole multitude of tasks or operations, even instructions on how to build something like an IKEA table would be done in a Markdown format. The uses are limitless and I feel really comfortable working one on one with the various TA's it really helped me grasp the concepts better.

Before I started this course, I had heard of GitHub, But honestly I knew nothing about it. I had no idea it was for programming at all.
This is important reading because its the foundation of my journey to becoming a software developer and eventually I want to get into Cyber Security. YOu need to understand the basics before you can move on to the more complicated coding languages and using Markdown and github is as simple as it comes. I honestly should be something taught to Kids in middle school if its not already. Git is whats called a Version Control System, or VCS. VCS's are responsible for changing and managing software, websites both large and small, that allows developers to keep track of modifications and changes in the code. This helps record everything that is done so if there is any errors, other developers can access the VCS remotely and troubleshoot the problem code.

Its vital that we learn this first because this will be the foundation of our career. Github allows multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time using git repositories and other programs like VSCode, Powershell or Ubuntu.
