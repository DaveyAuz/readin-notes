# Growth Mindset and Markdown

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes writing formatted text easy without needing complex tools like Microsoft Word. It was created in 2004 and is widely used for websites, documentation, and even books. You write in plain text with special symbols, and Markdown takes care of the formatting!

Here’s an example of Markdown in action:  
`#` creates a heading! (The more `#`, the smaller the heading).

## Why Use Markdown?

Markdown is used because it’s simple, portable, and future-proof. It's great for:
- Creating websites
- Writing notes
- Email messages
- Technical documentation
- Books

You don’t need fancy editors or apps — Markdown files can be opened with any basic text editor and converted to formats like HTML.

## Markdown Basics

### Headings

In Markdown, headings are created by using `#` for the largest heading and more `#` for smaller headings:
```markdown
# Heading 1 (largest)
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

## THE GROWTH MINDSET

The growth mindset is something I realized many years ago actually. That I used to view criticism as hatred instead of something that was helpful & a learning experience. I believe people are not meant to stop their thoughts and minds from evolving. Being fixed in a certain specific mindset will cause mental stagnation and prevent you from reaching your full potential, prevent you from effectively working in a diverse team where there are people who probably know more than you.

### Three Reminders For the Growth Mindset

    1) Always be humble and ask for help when needed.
    2) Always learn from mistakes.
    3) Never be the smartest person in the room.
