# Reading-Notes Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

JavaScript is one of the most common compiled programming languages used in webpages, application and even non-web based programs like Adobe acrobat which is the most common PDF file editor used around the world. It uses functional programming style, which means all the code is based on lambda calculus. It gives the definition of what is computable. Anything that can be computed by lambda calculus is computable. It is equivalent to Turing machine in its ability to compute. It provides a theoretical framework for describing functions and their evaluation. It forms the basis of almost all current functional programming languages. 
Fact: Alan Turing was a student of Alonzo Church who created Turing machine which laid the foundation of imperative programming style. 

Three Things I got from the videos:

* While computers have evolved over time from being the size of a living room to something that fits in your pocket, the process that a computer follows has not changed. 

Input->Storage->Processing->Output.

* Binary number systems multiply by 2's instead of by 10's. I never knew that!

* Pictures and Videos are controlled by binary numbers that run through tiny pixels that are either RRed, Green or Blue and each color gets a designated number. So the data thats showing a video is just tiny electrical signals controlling the pixels in your screen using millions of binary codes a second. Awesome!!!
