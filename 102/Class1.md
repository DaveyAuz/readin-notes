## THE GROWTH MINDSET

The growth mindset is something I realized many years ago actually. That I used to view criticism as hatred instead of something that was helpful & a learning experience. I believe people are not meant to stop their thoughts and minds from evolving. Being fixed in a certain specific mindset will cause mental stagnation and prevent you from reaching your full potential, prevent you from effectively working in a diverse team where there are people who probably know more than you.

### Three Reminders For the Growth Mindset

    1) Always be humble and ask for help when needed.
    2) Always learn from mistakes.
    3) Never be the smartest person in the room.
