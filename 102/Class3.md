# Reading-Notes Lab 3

This Lab & Exercise really taught me how to use markdown to create links and folders to organize a group of documents or pages which is going to be vital in future jobs to submit reports on issues, write protocols for a whole multitude of tasks or operations, even instructions on how to build something like an IKEA table would be done in a Markdown format. The uses are limitless and I feel really comfortable working one on one with the various TA's it really helped me grasp the concepts better.
