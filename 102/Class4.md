# Reading-Notes Revisions & The Cloud

Before I started this course, I had heard of GitHub, But honestly I knew nothing about it. I had no idea it was for programming at all. 
This is important reading because its the foundation of my journey to becoming a software developer and eventually I want to get into Cyber Security. YOu need to understand the basics before you can move on to the more complicated coding languages and using Markdown and github is as simple as it comes. I honestly should be something taught to Kids in middle school if its not already. Git is whats called a Version Control System, or VCS. VCS's are responsible for changing and managing software, websites both large and small, that allows developers to keep track of modifications and changes in the code. This helps record everything that is done so if there is any errors, other developers can access the VCS remotely and troubleshoot the problem code. 

Its vital that we learn this first because this will be the foundation of our career. Github allows multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time using git repositories and other programs like VSCode, Powershell or Ubuntu.
