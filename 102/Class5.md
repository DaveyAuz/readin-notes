# Reading-Notes Design web pages with CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Its a specific rule-based coding language used to change the style of a webpage. A CSS rule consists of two parts;
* A selector:

   * (EG- < h1 >) &

* A declaration block:

   * { color : red; font-size:36px}. 


The selector is the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block includes a CSS property name and a corresponding value, separated by a colon. The CSS code is written in a separate file from the HTML index to keep the codes separate in order to make the workflow more streamlined and easier to work with. It would be a nightmare if you had to enter in CSS Rules for each block of HTML code instead of designating a selector.
