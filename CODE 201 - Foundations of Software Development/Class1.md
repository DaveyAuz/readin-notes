# Reading-Notes Class 1: HTML ELEMENTS
>HTTP is the protocol that sends data between machines.
It uses packets of data that are sent and it seems
through the wires between servers and clients
But The packets are numbered
So while in the wires they are blundered
At the end they are put back in the correct order again.

> HTML is the backbone of the website. It contains the metadata, it tell the Javascript when and where to run, it cive CSS permission to run as well. A Browser PArses HTML first, then using the <link> tag it connects to the CSS file page which contains a whole plethora of elements from color schemes to fonts to animation. Then its parses to the <script> tag. This it for JavaScript. "The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, generates an in-memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS, and compiles and executes the parsed JavaScript." (1)

You cna find image files on many different platforms. The main thing you have to make sure of is that the image files are open source or fair use. IF they are not, you will have to get permission. This is a huge legal issue. I know as a music artist myself im very familiar with the DMCA.  

Javascript Variable are important because they are blocks of code that contain values. There are different variables used to talk to each other. Two variables are Strings and Numbers. Strings have quotes around them and numbers do not. 

String: let myVariable = 'Bob'; or
let myVariable = "Bob";

Number:	let myVariable = 10;

> HTML Attributes:

* HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
*HTML is made up of a series of hierarchical elements. Most elements have an opening tag and a closing tag, with some content sandwiched in between. Think of marking up chapters, headings and subheadings, this concept should be easy to grasp.
*Two elements are the <article> & the <section> elements. The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content. The <section> element defines section in a document.

>A typical website has and Doctype, HTML tag that compasses the entire HTML page, Meta, Head, Header, Style, Body, Div, Main, Footer and Script elements.

>metadata tells search engines how to read and display sites on search engine result pages (SERPs). To optimize your metadata for search engines, you should focus on your website's title tag and meta descriptions.

>The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data. <meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the code that you use to structure your web content and give it meaning and purpose. For example, is my content a set of paragraphs or a list of bullet points? Do I have images inserted on my page? Do I have a data table? Without overwhelming you, this article will provide enough information to make you familiar with HTML.

>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the code that you use to style your website. For example, do you want the text to be black or red? Where should content be drawn on the screen? What background images and colors should be used to decorate your website? In this article, we'll take you through what you need to get started.

>JavaScript is the programming language that you use to add interactive features to your website. Some examples could be games, things that happen when buttons are pressed or data is entered in forms, dynamic styling effects, animation, and much more. In this article, we'll give you an idea of what is possible with this exciting language, and how to get started.
