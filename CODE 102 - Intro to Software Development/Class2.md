# Reading-Notes The Coders Computer 2

Linux Brings me back to the days when I was a kid. It really brings me a sense of nostalgia having to type in commands to get games to load off the giant 5.25 inch floppy disks. Its crazy to think those disks only had 1.2 MB of data available on them and now, 30 years later I have a Solid State Hard Drive, 1/5th of the size that holds over 2,000,000x more data.

Using Ubuntu Has been really fun. It is a great Linux Terminal program, and using it with VSCode has been a learning curve but one that has been really enjoyable. The difference between VS code which is an IDE Text Editor, which stands for integrated development environment. It means that you can see your code changing in real time while you work on it. While Im typing this now I can see it changing. A Basic Text Editor would be like Windows Notepad or even Windows Notepad++.
